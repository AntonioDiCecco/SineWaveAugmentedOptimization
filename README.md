## Introduction

SineWaveAugmentedOptimization (SWAO) is a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm designed for solving complex optimization problems with high efficiency and stability. This repository provides an implementation of the SWAO algorithm, along with detailed comments to understand its inner workings.

## Key Features

- **Efficient**: Achieves top-tier performance in a wide array of benchmarks.
- **Stable**: Exhibits zero failures in 100 runs, showcasing its robustness.
- **Innovative**: Utilizes sine wave modulation to generate new candidate solutions, improving search diversity.
- **Detailed Comments**: Code is well-documented, making it easier to understand.

## Performance Comparison

After running the SWAO algorithm 100 times, here are the results:


Differential Evolution failed 0 times out of 100 runs.
Particle Swarm failed 26 times out of 100 runs.
SineWaveAugmentedOptimization failed 0 times out of 100 runs.


As you can see, SWAO not only has zero failures but also outperforms the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, making it significantly more stable and reliable.
